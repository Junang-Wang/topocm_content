# Quicker intro to quantum mechanics from waves to electrons
For most of this course, all you would need to know 
quantum mechanics is that particles should really be treated
as waves. We can always write a wave equation for waves in the form of the famous Schrodinger equation 
$$i\partial_t \Psi = H\Psi,$$
where at this point $\Psi$ is the "wave-function" and $H$ is the Hamiltonian. 

Just to give you a sense of how a familiar wave-equation for a string $$\partial_t^2 h-c^2\partial_x^2 h=0,$$ where $h(x,t)$ is the vertical displacement of the string.
