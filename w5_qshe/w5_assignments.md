## Simulations

### Kane-Mele model

The first known implementation of quantum spin Hall effect is the Kane-Mele model, introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0411737). It is a doubled copy of the Haldane model (get that one from the previous week's notebooks), with spin up and spin down having next-nearest neighbor hoppings complex conjugate of each other due to spin-orbit coupling.

Implement the Kane-Mele model and add a staggered onsite potential to also be able to create a trivial gap. Calculate the scattering matrix topological invariant of that model.

How would you add disorder and calculate the topological invariant? (Hint: you need to add disorder to the scattering region, and make leads on both sides conducting)

### Quantum Hall regime

The helical edge states of quantum spin Hall effect survive for some time when a magnetic field is added. Make a Hall bar out of the BHZ model. Can you reproduce the experimental results? What do you see? Are the inversion symmetry breaking terms important?

What about conductance in a two terminal geometry: can you see the crossover from quantum spin Hall regime to quantum Hall regime?
